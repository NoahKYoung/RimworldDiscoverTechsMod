//// TECHNOLOGY BLUEPRINTS RIMWORLD MOD \\\\

**Version 1.0.4**

**Description:**
This mod adds Technology Blueprints to the game. Discover the secrets of any research by using them!
These are rare items that can be dropped by enemies or bought at traders. Using one will consume it and unlock a random, researchable technology if the blueprint is under or equivalent to your era; otherwise, it will give you some progress towards the technology.

There are four types of blueprints:
- Neolithic blueprints
- Medieval blueprints
- Industrial blueprints
- Spacer blueprints

When you have mastered a technological era, you'll be able to research the capacity to craft your own technology blueprints at a Blueprint Bench and sell them to traders for profit!
This will make sure your researchers keep their minds sharp, and their work profitable ;)

Please send any feedback or suggestion our way!


**Mod compatibility:**
The blueprints will also unlock technology from other mods, and can be very useful if you utilize several mods that have their own research.
This should be compatible with all mods. However, we've had feedback that it does not work with Combat Extended and we will look into this in a further mod update.


**Known bugs:**
None currently.
Please send them to us so we can update this list and work on them!
